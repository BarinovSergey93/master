In the silent night beneath the stars,
I search for you but find no marks.
The wind whispers your words to me,
Then carries them far across the sea.

Through rain and storms, through mist and haze,
I walk ahead through winding ways.
My heart beats with a fiery flame,
Believing we will meet again.

Though roads are long and trials tough,
Though fate may play its games so rough,
I keep within a hopeful light,
That one day youâ€™ll be by my side.

And when the dawn begins to rise,
We'll leave behind all fears and lies.
Together strong, together free,
Together where we're meant to be.
